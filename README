# Primo

Primo is the first script to be installed on a newly installed Mac. 

Its a simple bash script with __zero__ dependencies that will install common utilities and applications to aid in the restoration of your Mac.

# Download

You can download the script by pasting the following command into Terminal.app

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shaps80/primo/master/primo.sh | bash
```

# Next Steps

After installing Primo, you can now install Dropbox and sync your files.

Once Dropbox has completed, you can then run `mackup restore` from Terminal.app to restore your applications preferences and other system configurations.
